# picoCTF-documentations

## *Quick Overview*

### What is this repository?

Just a bunch of markdown files in which I use to document and note down *hopefully* almost all actions I do while completing picoCTF picoGym challenges. I want to expand my knowledge on cyber-security so I found this website, ![picoCTF](https://picoctf.org) from a Youtube video someone made, that I don't remember. I always wanted to try my hand at capture the flag because the concept just seems really cool so why not try a whole website and organization based around it?

#### More to be added later if needed.
