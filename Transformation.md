# Transformation

Next challenge is Transformation, which tells us "I wonder what this really is... 'enc'". Followed by a code block: ''.join([chr((ord(flag[i]) << 8) + ord(flag[i + 1])) for i in range(0, len(flag), 2)]) . Well I tried what I did before, making the file executable using chmod +x enc and it printed an error on line 1. Ok. So I just checked the text of the file using nano and there is just some japanese or some gooby east asian language's scripture written here: 灩捯䍔䙻ㄶ形楴獟楮獴㌴摟潦弸弲㘶㠴挲ぽ. I have no idea what this means even google translate throws up. So I check the hint which says 'You may find some decoders online'. Well this may be encrypted but what is it????? So I proceed to check the file's hex. There is like nothing of value here. However my best guess was this was some unrecognized unicode crap becuase I think unicode just spits out goofy east asian looking characters when it doesnt recognize something. So I proceed to just go onto a unicode to text converter. Still just prints what the unicode codes *are* rather than giving me any flag. But I forgot all about the original code block! This text seems to be some python code so I guess I will make a .py script for this? i give up on this one ngl gg
