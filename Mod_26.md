# Mod 26

For this practice the description says, "Cryptography can be easy, do you know what ROT13 is?". As I am kinda stupid I don't know what ROT13 is. So I looked at the hint. The hint states that "this can be solved online if you don't want to do it by hand!". The challenge provides you with a string of text that is: cvpbPGS{arkg_gvzr_V'yy_gel_2_ebhaqf_bs_ebg13_GYpXOHqX} . I then immediatly looked up wtf is ROT13. The first result was a website named: ![https://rot13.com](https://rot13.com]. I was pretty sure I had this one done basically. I was presented with 2 boxes, 1 for input 1 for output along with a drop down to select which ROT I wanted. Turns out there are 25 total ROTs. ROT as said by ![CacheSleuth](https://www.cachesleuth.com/rot.html) is quickly explained as, "Provides the option to rotate numbers (Rot 5), letters (Rot 13), letters and numbers (Rot 18), all ASCII characters (Rot 47), or show all rotations from 0 to 25 either encrypted or decrypted.". Anyways we got our answer earlier from rot13.com so we just paste our answer into the flag submission box.
